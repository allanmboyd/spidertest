SpiderTest
==========

Overview
--------

SpiderTest is designed for lazy people - like me - who prefer to have a machine not only run a bunch of web tests but
also to kind of implement them too.

For example my website might have lots of different pages with links to other pages
and resources like images, css, javascript - whatever. Assuming all of those pages and resources are accessible via
URLs from some starting page (e.g. the home page) then I would like to make sure that all of those URLs work and that
they return the correct headers in the response. I might also want to ensure that common features on every html page like
headers, footers and menus are in the page and as expected. There might a subset of pages that should have the same
content and I might want to check this is true. I might want to run some tests against CSS or Javascript content that
is accessed also.

Ideally I don't want to write the same tests multiple times for common features. Also, I don't really want to have
to keep checking that all my tests cover all the links available especially since someone else could be modifying the
site. I want the machine to do these things for me.

Finally, I want to have test reporting flexibility. I don't want my reporters to be coupled to the tests. I
would like to be able to write reporters that don't have to worry about running tests and I would like to
provide more than one if I want.

SpiderTest aims to provide these features. It takes as input a start URL and a path to a folder containing test definitions
(it's BDD by the way so tests can be nice and descriptive). If it gets a response from the start URL it
looks for any tests matching the URL and executes the ones that it finds. Then it looks at the response to find more
links that it can request. If it finds any then it requests them, gets a response and executes any matching tests and
so the cycle continues until there are no more URLs to test. Each matching test that it finds it associates with the
corresponding URL. By discovering URLs and pairing them up with tests SpiderTest could be said to be automating test
generation. The test results for each URL tested are encapsulated within a test suite result set.

SpiderTest reporters are event driven - or at least event driven in the way SAX parsers are event driven (I'm not saying
that reporters are SAX parsers btw just that they operate in the same way). When all the tests have been executed the
test results are iterated. Test results are structured as a hierarchy that comprises of test suites, topics and tests.
Each visited URL that has one or more associated tests defines a test suite. Within a test suite (i.e. a matched URL)
there may be multiple topics and each topic may contain multiple individual tests.

Each reporter implements an interface defined within Reporter.js (this is documented below and in the code). The
reporter callback methods are invoked as the tests are iterated providing the necessary information to generated test
reports in a variety of formats at different levels of detail as required.
